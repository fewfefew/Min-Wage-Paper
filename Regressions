Simple Regressions:
RStudio
Must use 'fixest' package (will need other econometric-related packages)

1. Relationship between increase in minimum wage and annual average employment, controlling for variance in firm count:
feols(log(annual_avg_emplvl) ~ log(value) + log(annual_avg_estabs_count) | State + year, panel.id = c("State", "year"), data = bigdata)

2. Relationship between increase in minimum wage and annual taxable wages:
feols(log(taxable_annual_wages) ~ log(value) | State + year, panel.id = c("State","year"), data = bigdata)

3. Relationship between increase in minimum wage and establishment count: 
feols(log(annual_avg_estabs_count) ~ log(value) | State + year, panel.id = c("State","year"), data = bigdata)
